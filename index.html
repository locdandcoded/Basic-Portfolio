                    <p>My Name is Ebony Brown. I am a 28 year old full stack developer in training. I live in Nashville Tennessee but born and raised in Rockford Illinois. Rockford is a small city about 20 miles south of Wisconsin and 90 miles west of Chicago. I have a degree in Sociology but like many other graduates do not work in that field.</p> 
                
                    <p>One of my all time favorite passtime is to try new restaurants for brunch. In my free time I love to date my city and explore the different activies around the city. I am a mother to an awesome little 10 month old boy. He is the reason for my strength and determination</p>

                    <p>I love technology and hope to be a leader in the tech field for women of color with this Full Stack Developer program.</p>
